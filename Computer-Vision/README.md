This repo in general used to be for "Computer Vision" only, but I didn't really want
a separate repo for every miscellaneous course I take on Udacity.  So the parent directory
now houses subdirectories for various courses...  But not all, e.g., there are many web-related
courses I took on Udacity in the GrowWithGoogle repo.
